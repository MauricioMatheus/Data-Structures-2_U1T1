# Data Structures 2 - U1T1 - Introduction to Graph Theory

  ### Resume
  This repository contains a practical tutorial (Hands-On) that introduces basic concepts of graph theory using **Python** and the  `NetworkX` library.  
    


## Introduction
  The main objective of this tutorial is to reinforce knowledge of graph theory through a simple and practical approach. The `NetworkX` library is used for graph manipulation and `Matplotlib` for graphical visualization.


## Objectives
  • To introduce essential concepts of graph theory;  
    
  • To demonstrate the application of these concepts using Jupyter Notebook as a learning tool.

## Prerequisites
  • Python 3.x;  
    
  • Jupyter Notebook;  
    
  • NetworkX;  
    
  • Matplotlib;
